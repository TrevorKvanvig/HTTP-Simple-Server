# HTTP-Simple-Server
a simple web server that listens on a specified port and responds to HTTP GET requests from clients by serving requested files

Developed a Python-based web server proficient in processing incoming
HTTP GET requests and efficiently delivering requested files

Implemented stringent security protocols to regulate access to designated resources, maintaining data integrity, and ensured the server's responsiveness by managing HTTP status codes, including 200 (OK) and 404 (Not Found), for seamless file retrieval.
